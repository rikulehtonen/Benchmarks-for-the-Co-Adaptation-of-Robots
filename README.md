# Benchmarks for the Co-Adaptation of Robots

In this project, we created a physical benchmarking setup for the co-adaptation of walking quadruped robots. In concrete terms, this involves designing and building both a quadruped robot and a treadmill that allows for stationary benchmarking of the robot. In addition, developing software for operating the robot and interfacing with the co-adaptation algorithms was also necessary. This project repository contains CAD models for the robot and the treadmill and software for robot communication.
